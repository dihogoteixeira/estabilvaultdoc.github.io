  # This is a workaround to allow docs PRs to fullfil the required branch
  # protection rules which require that the 'build' workflow has
  # succeeded before a PR is allowed to be merged. We validate that via the
  # 'build-ensure-success' workflow that is triggered either by either the
  # 'build' or 'build-docs' workflow. Without this trigger the required branch
  # protection rules would never be met on docs branches.
