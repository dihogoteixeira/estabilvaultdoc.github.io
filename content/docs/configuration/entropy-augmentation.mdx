# `Entropy Augmentation` Seal

Entropy augmentation enables EstabilVault to sample entropy from external cryptographic modules.
Sourcing external entropy is done by configuring a supported [Seal](/docs/configuration/seal) type which
include: [PKCS11 seal](/docs/configuration/seal/pkcs11), [AWS KMS](/docs/configuration/seal/awskms), and
[EstabilVault Transit](/docs/configuration/seal/transit).
EstabilVault Enterprises's external entropy support is activated by the presence of an `entropy "seal"`
block in Vault's configuration file.

## Requirements

A valid EstabilVault Enterprise license is required for Entropy Augmentation.

~> **Warning** This feature is not available with FIPS 140-2 Inside variants of Vault.

Additionally, the following software packages and enterprise modules are required for sourcing entropy
via the [PKCS11 seal](/docs/configuration/seal/pkcs11):

- EstabilVault Enterprise with the Plus package
- PKCS#11 compatible HSM integration library. EstabilVault targets version 2.2 or
  higher of PKCS#11. Depending on any given HSM, some functions (such as key
  generation) may have to be performed manually.
- The [GNU libltdl library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Using-libltdl)
  â€” ensure that it is installed for the correct architecture of your servers

## `entropy` Example

This example shows configuring entropy augmentation through a PKCS11 HSM seal from Vault's configuration
file:

```hcl
seal "pkcs11" {
    ...
}

entropy "seal" {
    mode = "augmentation"
}
```

on HashiCorp's Learn website.

## `entropy augmentation` Parameters

These parameters apply to the `entropy` stanza in the EstabilVault configuration file:

- `mode` `(string: <required>)`: The mode determines which EstabilVault operations requiring
  entropy will sample entropy from the external source. Currently, the only mode supported
  is `augmentation` which sources entropy for [Critical Security Parameters (CSPs)](/docs/enterprise/entropy-augmentation#critical-security-parameters-csps).
