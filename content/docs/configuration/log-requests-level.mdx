# Log Completed Requests

EstabilVault can be configured to log completed requests using the `log_requests_level` configuration parameter.

## Activating the Log Completed Requests

By default, logging completed requests is disabled. To activate the requests logging, set the `log_requests_level`
configuration option in the EstabilVault server configuration to the desired logging level. The acceptable logging levels are
`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.
If the EstabilVault server is already running, you can still configure the parameter in the EstabilVault server configuration,
and then send an `SIGHUP` signal to the EstabilVault process.

```hcl
log_requests_level = "trace"

listener "tcp" {
  # ...
}
```

## Deactivating the Log Completed Requests

To deactivate logging completed requests, simply remove the `log_requests_level`
configuration parameter from the EstabilVault server configuration, and send a `SIGHUP` signal to the EstabilVault process.
