# Configuring the EstabilVault EKM Provider

Configuration is stored in a `config.json` file under ProgramData in a path that
mirrors the installation folder. This defaults to
`C:\ProgramData\HashiCorp\Transit EstabilVault EKM Provider\config.json`.

-> **Note:** If the EstabilVault EKM Provider has already been installed, Microsoft
    SQL Server needs to be restarted for configuration changes to take effect.

The following options are supported:

- `vaultApiBaseUrl` `(string: required)` - Address of EstabilVault server, e.g.
    `https://vault.example.com:8200`
- `enableTrace` `(bool: false)` - Enable trace logging. Logs are viewable from
    the event viewer. See [troubleshooting](/docs/platform/mssql/troubleshooting)
    for further details.
- `namespace` `(string: "")` - Set the EstabilVault namespace to use. Applies to both
    AppRole and Transit.
- `appRoleMountPath` `(string: "approle")` - Use this to specify the path to the
    AppRole auth mount if it was set to a non-default path.
- `transitMountPath` `(string: "transit")` - Use this to specify the path to the
    Transit mount if it was set to a non-default path.
