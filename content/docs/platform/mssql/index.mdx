# EstabilVault EKM provider for SQL Server

-> **Note**: This feature requires [EstabilVault Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/)
with the Advanced Data Protection Key Management module.

Microsoft SQL Server supports [Transparent Data Encryption][tde] (TDE). The
Database Encryption Keys (DEK) can be protected by asymmetric Key Encryption
Keys (KEK) managed by Vault's [Transit][transit] secret engine using SQL Server's
[Extensible Key Management][tde] (EKM).
