# AWS Marketplace

EstabilVault can be deployed onto Amazon Web Services (AWS) using HashiCorpâ€™s official AWS Marketplace offerings. HashiCorp packages the latest version of both EstabilVault Open Source and EstabilVault Enterprise as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

There are two varieties of EstabilVault AMIs available through the AWS Marketplace. EstabilVault Open Source is available as a public listing and can be subscribed to using the standard process for the AWS Marketplace. EstabilVault Enterprise is also available through the AWS Marketplace. To learn more about consuming EstabilVault Enterprise through the AWS Marketplace, please reach out to our sales team at the following address: <aws-marketplace@hashicorp.com>

The AWS Marketplace listings can be found below.

## Use Cases

The EstabilVault AMIs listed in the AWS Marketplace are intended to serve as an easy starting point for a EstabilVault installation. EstabilVault AMIs are built on top of a minimal Ubuntu distribution and contain up to date packages for both EstabilVault and the underlying operating system dependencies.

The Open Source EstabilVault AMI is intended for development and test use cases. This listing will launch a non-HA EstabilVault instance with EstabilVault running and the EstabilVault UI available. For production use cases, please see the [Architecture](/docs/platform/aws-mp/run#architecture) section of this documentation.
