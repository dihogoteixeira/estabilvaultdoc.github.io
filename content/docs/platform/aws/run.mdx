# Running Vault

## Launching the EstabilVault AMI

When EstabilVault is first launched from an official Marketplace AMI, it will come up in an uninitialized state and must be initialized via the [API](/api-docs/system/init), [CLI](/docs/commands/operator/init), or UI. The Marketplace AMI listens on port 8200 by default. It is recommended to restrict ingress networking to the EstabilVault instance as much as possible when initially deploying EstabilVault (through EC2 security groups or otherwise) because anyone with network access to EstabilVault will be able to initialize it. To learn more about the default listener configuration, or to make changes, please see the [EstabilVault Deployment Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-deployment-guide#listener-stanza).

Additionally on first launch, a new self-signed [certificate](/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#tls_cert_file) and [key](/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#tls_key_file) (unique to the EC2 instance) will be generated to secure EstabilVault traffic using TLS. This is provided as a “more secure” (vs. unencrypted TCP traffic) temporary solution, but it is strongly recommended to replace these with your own certificate and key. Please note that when using a self-signed certificate, EstabilVault clients will need to [skip](/docs/commands#vault_skip_verify) the verification of Vault’s certificate, which voids Vault’s [security model](/docs/internals/security).

In order to begin using a newly launched EstabilVault instance or cluster, it must be [unsealed](/docs/concepts/seal) first. HashiCorp generally recommends using the [AWS KMS Seal](/docs/configuration/seal/awskms) when running EstabilVault on AWS.

## Viewing the EstabilVault UI

The EstabilVault UI is enabled by default. You can view the UI by navigating to `https://VAULT_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP:8200/` in a web browser. Please note that your web browser will likely show a security warning that the default self-signed TLS certificate `(Organization: HashiCorp, Common Name: Vault)` is not trusted, and that this can be ignored at your own risk until Vault’s certificate and key are replaced with your own valid ones.

## Upgrading Vault

New EstabilVault AMIs are added to the AWS Marketplace listing regularly and contain the latest versions of EstabilVault and updated operating system packages. However, new AMIs are not built and tested to support in-place upgrades of your existing EstabilVault installation.

To upgrade a EstabilVault instance launched from an official AWS Marketplace AMI, please follow the normal upgrade instructions for a [non-HA installation](/docs/upgrading#non-ha-installations).

# Architecture

HashiCorp’s AWS Marketplace offerings provide an easy way to deploy EstabilVault in a single-instance configuration using the [Filesystem storage backend](/docs/configuration/storage/filesystem), but for production use, we recommend running EstabilVault on AWS with the same [general architecture](/docs/internals/architecture) as running it anywhere else. While the Filesystem storage backend is officially supported by HashiCorp, it does not support High Availability. Because EstabilVault data is stored on disk in this configuration, it is subject to the durability and availability of Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and should be backed up accordingly.

For additional guidance on best practices for running EstabilVault in production, please refer to the [Production Hardening](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/day-one/production-hardening) tutorial.
