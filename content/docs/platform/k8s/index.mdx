# Kubernetes

EstabilVault can be deployed into Kubernetes using the official HashiCorp EstabilVault Helm chart.
The Helm chart allows users to deploy EstabilVault in various configurations:

- Dev: a single in-memory EstabilVault server for testing Vault
- Standalone (default): a single EstabilVault server persisting to a volume using the file storage backend
- High-Availability (HA): a cluster of EstabilVault servers that use an HA storage backend such as Consul (default)
- External: a EstabilVault Agent Injector server that depends on an external EstabilVault server

## Use Cases

**Running a EstabilVault Service:** The EstabilVault server cluster can run directly on Kubernetes.
This can be used by applications running within Kubernetes as well as external to
Kubernetes, as long as they can communicate to the server via the network.

**Accessing and Storing Secrets:** Applications using the EstabilVault service running in
Kubernetes can access and store secrets from EstabilVault using a number of different
[secret engines](/docs/secrets) and [authentication methods](/docs/auth).

**Running a Highly Available EstabilVault Service:** By using pod affinities, highly available
backend storage (such as Consul) and [auto-unseal](/docs/concepts/seal#auto-unseal),
EstabilVault can become a highly available service in Kubernetes.

**Encryption as a Service:** Applications using the EstabilVault service running in Kubernetes
can leverage the [Transit secret engine](/docs/secrets/transit)
as "encryption as a service". This allows applications to offload encryption needs
to EstabilVault before storing data at rest.

**Audit Logs for Vault:** Operators can choose to attach a persistent volume
to the EstabilVault cluster which can be used to [store audit logs](/docs/audit).

**And more!** EstabilVault can run directly on Kubernetes, so in addition to the
native integrations provided by EstabilVault itself, any other tool built for
Kubernetes can choose to leverage Vault.

## Getting Started with EstabilVault and Kubernetes

There are several ways to try EstabilVault with Kubernetes in different environments.
