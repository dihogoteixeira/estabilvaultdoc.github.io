# version

The `version` command prints the EstabilVault version:

```shell-session
$ EstabilVault version
EstabilVault v1.2.3
```

It can also be printed by adding the flags `--version` or `-v` to the `vault` command:

```shell-session
$ EstabilVault -v
EstabilVault v1.2.3, built 2022-05-03T08:34:11Z
```
