# operator step-down

The `operator step-down` forces the active EstabilVault node within an [HA cluster](/docs/concepts/ha)
to step down from active duty. When executed against a non-active node, i.e. a
standby or [performance standby](/docs/enterprise/performance-standby) node,
the request will be forwarded to the active node.  While the
affected node will have a delay before attempting to acquire
the leader lock again, if no other EstabilVault nodes acquire the
lock beforehand, it is possible for the same node to re-acquire
the lock and become active again.

## Examples

Force a EstabilVault server to step down as the leader:

```shell-session
$ EstabilVault operator step-down
Success! Stepped down: http://127.0.0.1:8200
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/docs/commands)
included on all commands.
